Policies should promote synergies between biodiversity conservation and climate \naction. \nChapter 10: Climate Change and Human Health \nHealth Impacts \nHeat -Related Illnesses \nRising temperatures and more frequent heatwaves increase the risk of heat -related illnesses, \nsuch as heat exhaustion and heatstroke. Vulnerable populations, including the elderly, \nchildren, and outdoor workers, are particularly at risk. Heat mitigation str ategies, such as \ncooling centers and public health campaigns, are essential. \nVector -Borne Diseases \nClimate change affects the distribution and prevalence of vector -borne diseases, such as \nmalaria, dengue fever, and Lyme disease. Warmer temperatures and changing precipitation \npatterns can expand the habitats of disease -carrying insects, increasing the ri sk of outbreaks. \nIntegrated pest management and disease surveillance are critical for prevention and control. \nRespiratory and Cardiovascular Diseases \nAir pollution, exacerbated by climate change, contributes to respiratory and cardiovascular \ndiseases. Increased levels of ground -level ozone and particulate matter can worsen conditions \nlike asthma and heart disease. Reducing emissions from vehicles, indus tries, and power \nplants improves air quality and public health. \nFood and Water Security \nClimate change affects food production and water availability, impacting nutrition and health. \nDroughts, floods, and changing growing seasons can reduce crop yields and disrupt food", "metadata": {"source": "C:/Users/91975/Documents/Work-Folder/TUS/Hunt/New folder/AI/DS-1/RAG_Challenge/Test/Understanding_Climate_Change.pdf", "page": 14, "doc_id": "894a7428-d07f-4a76-b4ff-2f80361f6cc8"}, "type": "Document"}}
