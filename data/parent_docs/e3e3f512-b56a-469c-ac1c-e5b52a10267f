So figs \nare accounted fairest and ripest then, when they begin to shrink, and wither as it \nwere. So ripe olives, when they are next to putrefaction, then are they in their proper \nbeauty. The hanging down of grapes, the brow of a lion, the froth of a foaming wild \nboar, and many other like things, though by themselves considered, they are far from \nany beauty, yet because they happen naturally, they both are comely, and delightful; \nso that if a man shall with a profound mind and apprehension, consider all things in \nthe world, even among all those things which are but mere accessories and natural \nappendices as it were, there will scarce appear anything unto him, wherein he will \nnot find matter of pleasure and delight. So will he behold with as much pleasure the \ntrue rictus of wild beasts, as those which by skilful painters and other artificers are \nimitated. So will he be able to perceive the proper ripeness and beauty of old age, \nwhether in man or woman: and whatsoever else it is that is beautiful and alluring in \nwhatsoever is, with chaste and continent eyes he will soon find out and discern. \nThose and many other things will he discern, not credible unto every one, but unto \nthem only who are truly and familiarly acquainted, both with nature itself, and all \nnatural things.", "metadata": {"source": "uploaded_docs\\Test1.pdf", "page": 20, "doc_id": "b19c889b-9e49-458e-8f27-801b1483f72b"}, "type": "Document"}}
