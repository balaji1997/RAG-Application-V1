Despite a decline in some regions, coal remains a significant \nenergy source globally. It is mined extensively in countries like China, India, and the United \nStates, contributing significantly to their energy supplies and CO2 footprints. \nOil \nOil is used primarily for transportation fuels, such as gasoline and diesel. The combustion of \noil products releases significant amounts of CO2 and other pollutants, contributing to climate \nchange and air quality issues. The global oil industry is vast, in volving extraction, refining, \nand distribution, with significant geopolitical and economic implications. \nNatural Gas \nNatural gas is the least carbon -intensive fossil fuel and is often seen as a \"bridge fuel\" to a \nlower -carbon future. However, its extraction and use still contribute to greenhouse gas \nemissions, particularly methane, which is a potent greenhouse gas. Innov ations in fracking \ntechnology have made natural gas more accessible, but this comes with environmental and \nhealth concerns. \nDeforestation \nForests act as carbon sinks, absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere. When trees are cut down \nfor timber or to clear land for agriculture, this stored carbon is released back into the \natmosphere. Deforestation reduces the number of trees that can absorb CO2, exa cerbating the \ngreenhouse effect. \nTropical Deforestation", "metadata": {"source": "C:/Users/91975/Documents/Work-Folder/TUS/Hunt/New folder/AI/DS-1/RAG_Challenge/Test/Understanding_Climate_Change.pdf", "page": 1, "doc_id": "7b863913-1e20-4b52-99d7-da1dbb75c2f0"}, "type": "Document"}}
