Techniques include GPS -guided equipment, soil sensors, and data analytics. \nThese methods can optimize resource use, reduce emissions, and increase yields. \nAgroforestry \nAgroforestry integrates trees and shrubs into agricultural landscapes. This practice enhances \nbiodiversity, improves soil health, and sequesters carbon. It offers a sustainable alternative to \nconventional monoculture farming. \nRegenerative Agriculture \nRegenerative agriculture focuses on restoring soil health through practices like crop rotation, \ncover cropping, and reduced tillage. Healthy soils store more carbon and support resilient \necosystems. This approach can help mitigate climate change while impr oving farm \nproductivity.", "metadata": {"source": "C:/Users/91975/Documents/Work-Folder/TUS/Hunt/New folder/AI/DS-1/RAG_Challenge/Test/Understanding_Climate_Change.pdf", "page": 8, "doc_id": "ff5ffd8b-d463-4bbc-88ed-1ec38076a78b"}, "type": "Document"}}
