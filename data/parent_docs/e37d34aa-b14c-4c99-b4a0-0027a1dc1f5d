Global cooperation under the UNFCCC is crucial for coor dinated \nclimate action. \nParis Agreement \nThe Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees \nCelsius above pre -industrial levels, with efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. \nCountries submit nationally determined contributions (NDCs) outlining their climate action \nplans and targets. \nNational Strategies \nCarbon Pricing \nCarbon pricing mechanisms, such as carbon taxes and cap -and-trade systems, incentivize \nemission reductions by assigning a cost to carbon emissions. These policies encourage \nbusinesses and individuals to reduce their carbon footprints and invest in cleaner \ntechnologies. \nRenewable Energy Targets \nMany countries have set ambitious targets for renewable energy adoption.

Achieving these targets requires robust infrastructure and market dev elopment. \nEmission Reduction Regulations \nGovernments implement regulations to limit emissions from key sectors such as energy,", "metadata": {"source": "uploaded_docs\\Understanding_Climate_Change.pdf", "page": 9, "doc_id": "f4a44bf8-7e73-4f8d-9139-53b5b79d713b"}, "type": "Document"}}
