This allows every\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\n[38, 2, 9].\n\u2022The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the", "metadata": {"source": "uploaded_docs\\Attention_is_all_you_need.pdf", "page": 4, "doc_id": "f8529e1c-f9c1-414d-a420-e0b050999365"}, "type": "Document"}}
