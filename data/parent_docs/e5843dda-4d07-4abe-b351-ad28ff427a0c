Manure \nmanagement practices also contribute to methane and nitrous oxide emissions. Innovations in \nlivestock feeding and waste management can help mitigate these emissions. \nRice Cultivation \nFlooded rice paddies create anaerobic conditions that lead to methane production. Improved \nwater management and rice varieties can help reduce these emissions. Research into \nsustainable rice farming practices is crucial for balancing food security and clim ate goals. \nFertilizers \nThe use of synthetic fertilizers in agriculture releases nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas. \nPractices such as precision farming and organic fertilizers can mitigate these emissions. The \ndevelopment of eco -friendly fertilizers and farming techniques is essential for reducing the \nagricultural sector's carbon footprint. \nChapter 3: Effects of Climate Change \nThe effects of climate change are already being felt around the world and are projected to \nintensify in the coming decades. These effects include: \nRising Temperatures \nGlobal temperatures have risen by about 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) since \nthe late 19th century. This warming is not uniform, with some regions experiencing more \nsignificant increases than others. \nHeatwaves \nHeatwaves are becoming more frequent and severe, posing risks to human health, agriculture,", "metadata": {"source": "C:/Users/91975/Documents/Work-Folder/TUS/Hunt/New folder/AI/DS-1/RAG_Challenge/Test/Understanding_Climate_Change.pdf", "page": 2, "doc_id": "a19216c3-8b27-4b92-a57f-00a12d6d983a"}, "type": "Document"}}
