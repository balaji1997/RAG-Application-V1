Vulnerable populations, including low -income \ncommunities, indigenous peoples, and marginalized groups, often face the greatest ris ks \nwhile contributing the least to greenhouse gas emissions. Climate justice advocates for \nequitable solutions that address these disparities. \nEnvironmental Racism \nEnvironmental racism refers to the disproportionate exposure of communities of color to \nenvironmental hazards, including those exacerbated by climate change. Addressing \nenvironmental racism involves identifying and mitigating the sources of pollution and \nensuring that all communities have access to clean air, water, and safe living conditions. \nInclusive Policies \nInclusive climate policies consider the needs and voices of all affected populations. This \nincludes engaging diverse stakeholders in decision -making processes and designing policies \nthat promote equity. Measures such as targeted support for vulnerable comm unities and \nequitable access to climate adaptation resources are essential.", "metadata": {"source": "C:/Users/91975/Documents/Work-Folder/TUS/Hunt/New folder/AI/DS-1/RAG_Challenge/Test/Understanding_Climate_Change.pdf", "page": 18, "doc_id": "20b825ff-2d2b-4dd2-8580-a318177c1e71"}, "type": "Document"}}
