Proceed now on to the rest that have been since that of Augustus. Hath death \ndwelt with them otherwise, though so many and so stately whilst they lived, than it \ndoth use to deal with any one particular man? Consider now the death of a whole \nkindred and family, as of that of the Pompeys, as that also that useth to be written \nupon some monuments, HE WASS THE LAST OF HIS OWN KINDRED. O what care did his \npredecessors take, that they might leave a successor, yet behold at last one or other \nmust of necessity be THE LAST. Here again therefore consider the death of a whole \nkindred. \nXXX. Contract thy whole life to the measure and proportion of one single action. And \nif in every particular action thou dost perform what is fitting to the utmost of thy \npower, let it suffice thee. And who can hinder thee, but that thou mayest perform \nwhat is fitting? But there may be some outward let and impediment. Not any, that \ncan hinder thee, but that whatsoever thou dost, thou may do it, justly, temperately, \nand with the praise of God. Yea, but there may be somewhat, whereby some opera - \ntion or other of thine may he hindered.
