The configuration of this model is\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5days on 8P100 GPUs. Even our base model\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\nthe competitive models.\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4the training cost of the\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\ndropout rate Pdrop= 0.1, instead of 0.3.\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\nused beam search with a beam size of 4and length penalty \u03b1= 0.6[38]. These hyperparameters\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU5.\n6.2 Model Variations", "metadata": {"source": "uploaded_docs\\Attention_is_all_you_need.pdf", "page": 7, "doc_id": "42cafc31-d9a9-4385-b1d3-8fa20f6bfc5c"}, "type": "Document"}}
