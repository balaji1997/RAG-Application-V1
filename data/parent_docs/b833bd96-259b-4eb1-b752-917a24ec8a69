Theophrastus, where he compares sin with sin (as after a vulgar sense such \nthings I grant may be compared): says well and like a philosopher, that those sins \nare greater which are committed through lust, than those which are committed \nthrough anger. For he that is angry seems with a kind of grief and close contraction \nof himself, to turn away from reason; but he that sins through lust, being overcome \nby pleasure, doth in his very sin bewray a more impotent, and unmanlike disposi - \ntion. Well then and like a philosopher doth he say, that he of the two is the more to \nbe condemned, that sins with pleasure, than he that sins with grief. For indeed this \nlatter may seem first to have been wronged, and so in some manner through grief \nthereof to have been forced to be angry, whereas he who through lust doth commit \nanything, did of himself merely resolve upon that action. \nVIII.
