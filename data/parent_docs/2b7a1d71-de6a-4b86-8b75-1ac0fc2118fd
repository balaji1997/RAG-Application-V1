This affects agriculture, water supply, and ecosystems, particularly in \narid and semi -arid regions. Droughts can lead to food and water shorta ges and exacerbate \nconflicts. \nFlooding \nHeavy rainfall events are becoming more common, leading to increased flooding. Urban \nareas with poor drainage and infrastructure are particularly at risk. Flood management \nstrategies include improved drainage systems, green infrastructure, and floodplain r estoration. \nOcean Acidification \nIncreased CO2 levels in the atmosphere lead to higher concentrations of CO2 in the oceans. \nThis causes the water to become more acidic, which can harm marine life, particularly \norganisms with calcium carbonate shells or skeletons, such as corals and some s hellfish. \nCoral Reefs", "metadata": {"source": "C:/Users/91975/Documents/Work-Folder/TUS/Hunt/New folder/AI/DS-1/RAG_Challenge/Test/Understanding_Climate_Change.pdf", "page": 3, "doc_id": "fb5c1625-57f9-4028-9d09-bddfc6deb534"}, "type": "Document"}}
