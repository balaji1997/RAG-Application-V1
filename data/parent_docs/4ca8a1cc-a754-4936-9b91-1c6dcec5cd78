The Commission may decide on its own, or via a qualified alert from the scientific panel of independent experts, that a model has high impact capabilities, rendering it systemic.\n\nIn addition to the four obligations above, providers of GPAI models with systemic risk must also:\n\nPerform model evaluations, including conducting and documenting adversarial testing to identify and mitigate systemic risk.\n\nAssess and mitigate possible systemic risks, including their sources.\n\nTrack, document and report serious incidents and possible corrective measures to the AI Office and relevant national competent authorities without undue delay.\n\nEnsure an adequate level of cybersecurity protection.", "metadata": {"source": "uploaded_docs\\EU AI Act Doc.docx", "doc_id": "85f9ade0-4eb1-4a79-a87f-202bfa94e016"}, "type": "Document"}}
