It \nmay have antioxidant and anti -inflammatory activity [10, 18]. \nEvidence obtained with an in vitro oxidation model for heart \ndisease h as demonstrated that several plant flavonols, such as \nquercetin, myricetin and rutin, are more powerful antioxidants \nthan the traditional vitamins [15]. So there are grounds for \nencouraging the consumption of vegetables and other foods \nrich in flavonols. F lavones includeapigenin and luteolin. \nFlavones have been detected in conjugated form in celery, \ntomato, brinjal, garlic and onion [10]. In recent years, scientific \nand public interest in flavones has grown enormously due to \ntheir putative beneficial effect s against atherosclerosis, \nosteoporosis, diabetes mellitus and certain cancers [15]. The \nmechanism action of flavones on chronic diseases is similar to \nthat of other flavonoids. Isoflavonoids including daidzen, \ngenistein, and glycitein have limited distrib ution in \nvegetables. They exist mainly in legumes including soybean, \nlentil and chickpea. Small quantities have been detected in \nvegetables such as broccoli, asparagus, alfalfa sprouts, okra \nand mushrooms [10, 15]. Isoflavones have received considerable \nattention as potentially preventing and treating cancer and \nosteoporosis [31]. \n \n3.
