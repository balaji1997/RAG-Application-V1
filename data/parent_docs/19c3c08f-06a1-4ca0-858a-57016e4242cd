Not only do individual attention\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\n5 Training\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\nvocabulary [ 38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\ntarget tokens.\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\n(3.5 days).\n5.3 Optimizer\nWe used the Adam optimizer [ 20] with \u03b21= 0.9,\u03b22= 0.98and\u03b5= 10\u22129.
