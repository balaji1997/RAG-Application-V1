Smart grids enhance grid reliability, reduce energy waste, and support the \ntransition to renewable energy. \nInternet of Things (IoT) \nIoT devices can optimize energy use in homes, buildings, and industries. Smart thermostats, \nlighting systems, and appliances can adjust their operation based on occupancy and usage \npatterns, reducing energy consumption. IoT also enables predictive maintena nce and efficient \nresource management. \nArtificial Intelligence (AI) \nAI can analyze large datasets to optimize energy systems, predict climate impacts, and \nenhance climate resilience. Applications include smart grid management, climate modeling, \nand precision agriculture. AI -driven solutions can improve efficiency, reduce c osts, and \nsupport data -driven decision -making. \nCarbon Capture and Utilization \nCarbon Capture and Storage (CCS) \nCCS technology captures CO2 emissions from industrial processes and power plants and \nstores it underground. This technology is critical for reducing emissions from hard -to-abate \nsectors. Developing cost -effective and scalable CCS solutions is essential for achieving \nclimate goals. \nCarbon Utilization \nUtilizing captured CO2 to produce valuable products, such as synthetic fuels, chemicals, and \nbuilding materials, can create economic opportunities and reduce emissions. Research into \ncarbon utilization technologies is advancing, with potential applications in various industries. \nDirect Air Capture (DAC)", "metadata": {"source": "C:/Users/91975/Documents/Work-Folder/TUS/Hunt/New folder/AI/DS-1/RAG_Challenge/Test/Understanding_Climate_Change.pdf", "page": 22, "doc_id": "5a725c86-1ee0-4e11-b841-bd13ac46453a"}, "type": "Document"}}
