Deforestation in the \nAmazon, Congo Basin, and Southeast Asia has significant impacts on global carbon cycles \nand biodiversity. These regions are often cleared for agriculture, logging, and mining, leading \nto habitat loss and species extinction. \nBoreal Forests \nBoreal forests, found in the northern regions of North America, Europe, and Asia, also play a \ncrucial role in sequestering carbon. Logging and land -use changes in these regions contribute \nto climate change. These forests are vital for regulating the Earth' s climate and supporting \nindigenous communities and wildlife. \nAgriculture \nAgriculture contributes to climate change through methane emissions from livestock, rice \npaddies, and the use of synthetic fertilizers. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas with a much \nhigher heat -trapping capability than CO2, albeit in smaller quantities. \nLivestock Emissions", "metadata": {"source": "C:/Users/91975/Documents/Work-Folder/TUS/Hunt/New folder/AI/DS-1/RAG_Challenge/Test/Understanding_Climate_Change.pdf", "page": 1, "doc_id": "7b863913-1e20-4b52-99d7-da1dbb75c2f0"}, "type": "Document"}}
