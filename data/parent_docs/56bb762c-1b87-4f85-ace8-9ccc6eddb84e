The term \n\"global climate\" encompasses the planet's overall weather patterns, including temperature, \nprecipitation, and wind patterns, over an extended period. Over the past cent ury, human \nactivities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, have significantly \ncontributed to climate change. \nHistorical Context \nThe Earth's climate has changed throughout history. Over the past 650,000 years, there have \nbeen seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat, with the abrupt end of the last ice age about \n11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era and human civilization. \nMost of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth's orbit that \nchange the amount of solar energy our planet receives. During the Holocene epoch, which \nbegan at the end of the last ice age, human societies f lourished, but the industrial era has seen \nunprecedented changes. \nModern Observations \nModern scientific observations indicate a rapid increase in global temperatures, sea levels, \nand extreme weather events. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has \ndocumented these changes extensively. Ice core samples, tree rings, and ocean sediments \nprovide a historical record that scientists use to understand past climate conditions and", "metadata": {"source": "uploaded_docs\\Understanding_Climate_Change.pdf", "page": 0, "doc_id": "3e8526e1-87ce-4dc4-801a-b41e70abebef"}, "type": "Document"}}
