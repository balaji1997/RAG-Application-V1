Fortunately the body has a natural \ndefense system against cellular damage by free radicals, \nwhich comprise primarily of antioxidant nutrients (e.g., \nvitamin E, vitamin C, and certain carotenoids), which are \nassisted by a variety of phyto -chemicals from the diet. \nVitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals contained in fruits \nand vegetables each have antioxidant activity. Orange and \nyellow fruits and vegetables, as well as green leafy \nvegetables, are rich sources of carotenoids. Good sources of \nvitamin E include nuts and seeds, wheat germ, and vegetable \noils. With the exception of vitamin E, these antioxidants are \nwidely' distributed in fruits and vegetables [10]. They have \nbeen investigated for their specific role in the prevention of \ncancers, heart disease, eye disease and other human health \nconditions [17, 18]. \n \n2.5 Carotenoids \nCarotenoids are a class highly pigment which is responsible \nfor yellow, orange and red color in fruits and vegetables. \nCarotenoids like lycopene, \u03b2 - carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin are \nknown to be the most efficient singlet oxygen quencher in the \nbiological systems without the production of any oxidizing \nproducts. \u03b2 -carotene traps peroxy free radicals in tissues at \nlow oxygen concentrations. Hence \u03b2 -carotene complements \nthe antioxidant properties of vitamin E [25].
