Numerous\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht\u22121and the input for position t. This inherently\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [ 21] and conditional\ncomputation [ 32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\nthe input or output sequences [ 2,19]. In all but a few cases [ 27], however, such attention mechanisms", "metadata": {"source": "uploaded_docs\\Attention_is_all_you_need.pdf", "page": 1, "doc_id": "b6ce35e9-dfd8-43c7-9a7e-2fe05ad453bc"}, "type": "Document"}}
