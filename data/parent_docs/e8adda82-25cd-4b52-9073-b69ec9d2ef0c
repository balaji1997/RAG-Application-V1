Casaubon v. 8.16, uploaded to www.philaletheians.co.uk, \n14 July 2013 \n \nforesee it, but moreover dost wonder at it, that such a thing should be. But then es - \npecially, when thou dost find fault with either an unthankful, or a false man, must \nthou reflect upon thyself. For without all question, thou thyself art much in fault, if \neither of one that were of such a disposition, thou didst expect that he should be true \nunto thee: or when unto any thou didst a good turn, thou didst not there bound thy \nthoughts, as one that had obtained his end; nor didst not think that from the action \nitself thou hadst received a full reward of the good that thou hadst done. For what \nwouldst thou have more? Unto him that is a man, thou hast done a good turn: doth \nnot that suffice thee? What thy nature required, that hast thou done. Must thou be \nrewarded for it? As if either the eye for that it seeth, or the feet that they go, should \nrequire satisfaction. For as these being by nature appointed for such an use, can \nchallenge no more, than that they may work according to their natural constitution: \nso man being born to do good unto others whensoever he doth a real good unto any \nby helping them out of error; or though but in middle things, as in matter of wealth, \nlife, preferment, and the like, doth help to further their desires he doth that for which \nhe was made, and therefore can require no more. \nMEDITATIONS OF MARCUS AURELIUS", "metadata": {"source": "uploaded_docs\\Test1.pdf", "page": 124, "doc_id": "3332d679-37f6-4c2c-a8bf-d68cac9eaea2"}, "type": "Document"}}
