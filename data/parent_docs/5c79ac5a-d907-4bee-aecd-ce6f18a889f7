Research \ninto carbon utilization technologies is expanding rapidly, with promising a pplications in \nmultiple industries. \nSustainable Transportation \nElectric Vehicles \nElectric vehicles (EVs) produce zero tailpipe emissions and can be powered by renewable \nenergy. Advances in battery technology are extending EV range and reducing costs, making \nthem a more attractive option for consumers and businesses. Infrastructure deve lopment, such \nas charging stations, is crucial for widespread EV adoption. \nHydrogen Fuel Cells \nHydrogen fuel cells generate electricity by combining hydrogen with oxygen, producing only \nwater as a byproduct. Fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) offer a clean alternative to conventional \nvehicles, particularly for heavy -duty applications like trucks and buses. D eveloping a robust \nhydrogen infrastructure is essential for their success. \nPublic Transportation Innovations \nInvestments in efficient and reliable public transportation systems can reduce the number of \nprivate vehicles on the road, lowering emissions. Innovations include electric buses, light rail \nsystems, and bike -sharing programs. Urban planning that prioritize s public transportation and \nnon-motorized transit is key. \nSustainable Agriculture and Land Use \nPrecision Agriculture", "metadata": {"source": "uploaded_docs\\Understanding_Climate_Change.pdf", "page": 8, "doc_id": "a08e3c81-3e3e-4196-8157-ae35b7b553e8"}, "type": "Document"}}
