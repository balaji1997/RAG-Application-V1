These changes can lead to altered water \nquality, habitat loss, and reduced biodiversity. Freshwater species, inclu ding fish and \namphibians, are particularly at risk. \nConservation Strategies \nProtected Areas \nEstablishing and managing protected areas is crucial for conserving biodiversity. These areas \nprovide refuges for species, help maintain ecosystem services, and offer opportunities for \nscientific research and education. Expanding and connecting protected a reas can enhance \ntheir effectiveness. \nHabitat Restoration \nRestoring degraded habitats can help reverse biodiversity loss and improve ecosystem \nresilience. Restoration efforts may include reforestation, wetland reconstruction, and soil \nrehabilitation. Engaging local communities in restoration projects ensures sust ainability and \nlong-term success. \nEx-Situ Conservation \nEx-situ conservation involves protecting species outside their natural habitats, such as in \nzoos, botanical gardens, and seed banks. These efforts can preserve genetic diversity, support \nbreeding programs, and facilitate reintroduction into the wild. Ex -situ conservation \ncomplements in -situ efforts. \nIntegrating Biodiversity and Climate Action \nNature -Based Solutions \nNature -based solutions leverage natural processes to address climate change while enhancing", "metadata": {"source": "uploaded_docs\\Understanding_Climate_Change.pdf", "page": 13, "doc_id": "32ecb121-4fcf-469b-a855-9781b5cb0ab6"}, "type": "Document"}}
