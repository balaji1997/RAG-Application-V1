Casaubon v. 8.16, uploaded to www.philaletheians.co.uk, \n14 July 2013 \n \nTHE NINTH BOOK \nE THAT IS UNJUST, is also impious. For the nature of the universe, having \nmade all reasonable creatures one for another, to the end that they should \ndo one another good; more or less according to the several persons and oc - \ncasions but in nowise hurt one another: it is manifest that he that doth transgress \nagainst this her will, is guilty of impiety towards the most ancient and venerable of \nall the deities. For the nature of the universe, is the nature the common parent of all, \nand therefore piously to be observed of all things that are, and that which now is, to \nwhatsoever first was, and gave it its being, hath relation of blood and kindred. She is \nalso called truth and is the first cause of all truths. He therefore that willingly and \nwittingly doth lie, is impious in that he doth receive, and so commit injustice: but he \nthat against his will, in that he disagreeth from the nature of the universe, and in \nthat striving with the nature of the world he doth in his particular, violate the general \norder of the world. For he doth no better than strive and war against it, who contrary \nto his own nature applieth himself to that which is contrary to truth. For nature had \nbefore furnished him with instincts and opportunities sufficient for the attainment of \nit; which he having hitherto neglected, is not now able to discern that which is false", "metadata": {"source": "uploaded_docs\\Test1.pdf", "page": 110, "doc_id": "24d12a66-d257-4321-82ef-aa1438b3478e"}, "type": "Document"}}
