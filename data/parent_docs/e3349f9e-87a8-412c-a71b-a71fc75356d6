During periods of high electricity demand, water is released from the \nupper reservoir to generate electricity. This method provides a large -scale, long-duration \nstorage solution. \nCarbon Capture and Utilization \nDirect Air Capture \nDirect air capture (DAC) technology involves removing CO2 directly from the atmosphere. \nThe captured CO2 can be stored underground or used in various industrial processes. DAC is \nan emerging technology with the potential to play a significant role in achie ving net -zero \nemissions. \nCarbon Utilization", "metadata": {"source": "uploaded_docs\\Understanding_Climate_Change.pdf", "page": 7, "doc_id": "54cb461e-ae8c-47d9-82d1-e50831f8b875"}, "type": "Document"}}
