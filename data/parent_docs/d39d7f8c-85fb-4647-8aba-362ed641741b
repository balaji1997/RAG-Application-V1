Ecosystem restoration projects can \ninvolve reforestation, wetland rehabilitation, and coral reef restoration. En gaging local \ncommunities in restoration efforts ensures sustainability. \nSustainable Land Management \nSustainable land management practices, such as agroforestry, conservation agriculture, and \nsustainable forestry, support ecosystem health and resilience. These practices improve soil \nhealth, enhance biodiversity, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Integr ating sustainable \nland management into policies and programs is essential for climate resilience. \nCoastal Protection \nProtecting and restoring coastal ecosystems, such as mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrasses, \nreduces the impacts of sea level rise and storm surges. These ecosystems act as natural \nbarriers, protecting coastal communities and infrastructure. Coastal prote ction measures \nshould combine natural and engineered solutions.", "metadata": {"source": "uploaded_docs\\Understanding_Climate_Change.pdf", "page": 25, "doc_id": "9da46c2e-fa0f-4a0f-bc00-903972ed28f8"}, "type": "Document"}}
