Ocean acidification \nand warming waters contribute to coral bleaching and mortality, threatening biodiversity and \nfisheries. Protecting and restoring coral reefs is essential for marine conservation. \nMarine Ecosystems \nAcidification affects the health and survival of various marine species, disrupting food webs \nand ecosystems. This has implications for commercial fisheries and the livelihoods of people \nwho depend on the ocean. Efforts to reduce CO2 emissions and enhance marine protected \nareas are vital. \nChapter 4: Mitigation and Adaptation \nAddressing climate change requires a two -pronged approach: mitigation and adaptation. \nMitigation involves reducing or preventing the emission of greenhouse gases, while \nadaptation involves making adjustments to social, economic, and environmental practices to \nminimize the damage caused by climate change. \nRenewable Energy \nTransitioning to renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power, is \ncrucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These sources produce little to no emissions \nand are sustainable in the long term. \nSolar Power \nSolar power harnesses energy from the sun using photovoltaic cells or solar thermal systems. \nIt is a versatile and scalable solution for reducing carbon emissions. Advances in solar \ntechnology and decreasing costs make it an attractive option for many regi ons. \nWind Power", "metadata": {"source": "uploaded_docs\\Understanding_Climate_Change.pdf", "page": 4, "doc_id": "89390b9c-2618-4d0e-8ecb-1b4e1da404e6"}, "type": "Document"}}
