Antarctic ice sheets are also losing mass, contributing to sea level rise. This melting \naffects global ocean currents and weather patterns. \nGlacial Retreat \nGlaciers around the world are retreating, affecting water supplies for millions of people. \nRegions dependent on glacial meltwater, such as the Himalayas and the Andes, face \nparticular risks. Glacial melt also impacts hydropower generation and agriculture. \nCoastal Erosion \nRising sea levels and increased storm surges are accelerating coastal erosion, threatening \nhomes, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Low -lying islands and coastal regions are especially \nvulnerable. Coastal communities must invest in adaptation measures like s ea walls and \nmanaged retreats. \nExtreme Weather Events \nClimate change is linked to an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather \nevents, such as hurricanes, heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall. These events can have \ndevastating impacts on communities, economies, and ecosystems. \nHurricanes and Typhoons \nWarmer ocean temperatures can intensify hurricanes and typhoons, leading to more \ndestructive storms. Coastal regions are at heightened risk of storm surge and flooding. Early \nwarning systems and resilient infrastructure are critical for mitigating these ri sks. \nDroughts \nIncreased temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are contributing to more frequent", "metadata": {"source": "C:/Users/91975/Documents/Work-Folder/TUS/Hunt/New folder/AI/DS-1/RAG_Challenge/Test/Understanding_Climate_Change.pdf", "page": 3, "doc_id": "fb5c1625-57f9-4028-9d09-bddfc6deb534"}, "type": "Document"}}
