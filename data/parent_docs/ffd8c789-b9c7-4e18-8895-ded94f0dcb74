Cities are particularly vulnerable due to the \"urban heat island\" effect. \nHeatwaves can lead to heat -related illnesses and exacerbate existing h ealth conditions. \nChanging Seasons \nClimate change is altering the timing and length of seasons, affecting ecosystems and human \nactivities. For example, spring is arriving earlier, and winters are becoming shorter and \nmilder in many regions. This shift disrupts plant and animal life cycles a nd agricultural \npractices. \nMelting Ice and Rising Sea Levels \nWarmer temperatures are causing polar ice caps and glaciers to melt, contributing to rising \nsea levels. Sea levels have risen by about 20 centimeters (8 inches) in the past century, \nthreatening coastal communities and ecosystems. \nPolar Ice Melt", "metadata": {"source": "C:/Users/91975/Documents/Work-Folder/TUS/Hunt/New folder/AI/DS-1/RAG_Challenge/Test/Understanding_Climate_Change.pdf", "page": 2, "doc_id": "a19216c3-8b27-4b92-a57f-00a12d6d983a"}, "type": "Document"}}
