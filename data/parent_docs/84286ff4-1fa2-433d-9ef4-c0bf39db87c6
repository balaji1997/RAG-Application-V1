To improve computational performance for tasks involving\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k)convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\norO(logk(n))in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\nconsiderably, to O(k\u00b7n\u00b7d+n\u00b7d2). Even with k=n, however, the complexity of a separable\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\nthe approach we take in our model.\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models.
