Vegetables in the daily diet \nhave been strongly associated with overall good health, \nimprovement of gastrointestinal health and visi on, reduced \nrisk for some forms of cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, \nanaemia, gastric ulcer, rheumatoid arthritis and other chronic \ndiseases [5, 8]. Some efforts to increase nutrient intake have been made by \nbiofortification and nutrient supplement ation. A Bio fortifying \nstaple crop is increasingly used as a complementary strategy \nfor combating micronutrient malnutrition among the poor in \ndeveloping countries [14]. Maize ( Zea mays L.) biofortified \nwith \u03b2 -carotene and rice ( Oryza sativa L.) biofortifi ed with \niron or \u03b2 -carotene are examples of efforts to increase \nmicronutrient uptake in staple -heavy diets. Supplements are \ncommonly available in developed countries and can be used \nto provide the required micronutrients among populations", "metadata": {"source": "uploaded_docs\\Test-2.pdf", "page": 1, "doc_id": "f56e269d-2470-46fe-89c7-e2d54c28a41d"}, "type": "Document"}}
