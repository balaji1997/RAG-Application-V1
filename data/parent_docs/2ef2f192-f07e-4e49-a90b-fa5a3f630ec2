The evidence overwhelmingly shows that recent changes are primarily \ndriven by human activities, particularly the emission of greenhou se gases. \nChapter 2: Causes of Climate Change \nGreenhouse Gases \nThe primary cause of recent climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases in the \natmosphere. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous \noxide (N2O), trap heat from the sun, creating a \"greenhouse effect.\" This effect is essential \nfor life on Earth, as it keeps the planet warm enough to support life. However, human \nactivities have intensified this natural process, leading to a warmer climate. \nFossil Fuels \nBurning fossil fuels for energy releases large amounts of CO2. This includes coal, oil, and \nnatural gas used for electricity, heating, and transportation. The industrial revolution marked \nthe beginning of a significant increase in fossil fuel consumption, which continues to rise \ntoday. \nCoal", "metadata": {"source": "C:/Users/91975/Documents/Work-Folder/TUS/Hunt/New folder/AI/DS-1/RAG_Challenge/Test/Understanding_Climate_Change.pdf", "page": 0, "doc_id": "4a9cf4f0-8210-4d24-b68d-2dea6c216eb4"}, "type": "Document"}}
