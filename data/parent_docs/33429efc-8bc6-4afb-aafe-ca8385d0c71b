We chose the sinusoidal version\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\nduring training.\n4 Why Self-Attention\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\n(x1, ..., x n)to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., z n), with xi, zi\u2208Rd, such as a hidden\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\nconsider three desiderata.\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to", "metadata": {"source": "uploaded_docs\\Attention_is_all_you_need.pdf", "page": 5, "doc_id": "b763706c-51cc-408a-ac12-5a4b93c6971c"}, "type": "Document"}}
