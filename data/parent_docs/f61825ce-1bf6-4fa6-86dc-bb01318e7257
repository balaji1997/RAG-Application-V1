To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\nlearned and fixed [9].\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\nPE(pos,2i)=sin(pos/100002i/d model)\nPE(pos,2i+1)=cos(pos/100002i/d model)\nwhere posis the position and iis the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2\u03c0to10000 \u00b72\u03c0. We\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by", "metadata": {"source": "uploaded_docs\\Attention_is_all_you_need.pdf", "page": 5, "doc_id": "b763706c-51cc-408a-ac12-5a4b93c6971c"}, "type": "Document"}}
